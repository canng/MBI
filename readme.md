## Modified Bare soil Index (MBI)
<hr>

A modified bare soil index (MBI) was introduced to highlight bare soil features using shortwave infrared (SWIR) and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths derived from Landsat surface reflectance.

MBI value ranges from −0.5 to + 1.5, in which bare soil is emphasized and received positive values until maxima.
